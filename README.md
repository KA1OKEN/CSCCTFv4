The challenge CTF_World basically has a minecraft world uploaded with it in which you have to download the zip file and extract the files from it. Now, if you don't have minecraft, it's best that you install TLauncher from https://tlauncher.org/en/ to play the game.


Once you've done all that. You need to insert the minecraft world you installed into the save files of the game.

How you might ask?
Type in the windows start button, %appdata%

Open the folder and then you will see a .minecraft folder. You will go on to open that folder.

You will then find a folder called saves.

Open the folder and there you can drag and drop your CTF_World file after you extracted it.
(Make sure the folder CTF_World folder isn't inside another CTF_World folder.)

Now you are ready to play the game!

Open TLauncher

Then write any account name you want then enter the game. (It might take sometime to open up.)

Once you're in the game, open Singleplayer and you must see the world loaded there.

Load into the world.
You will see that you are surrounded by bedrocks and signs all around you. (Bedrocks are unbreakable blocks in minecraft unless you are in creative mode.)

If you try any typical commands in minecrafts by pressing / on your keyboard such as /gamemode creative, it will not work since all cheats seem to be disabled and you are restricted.

We need to find a way to enable creative mode in this world.
Well, there is a way...

Press the ESC button on your keyboard when you're inside the world. You will find a button Open to LAN. Click on it.

 You will find these settings to open your world locally. This feature is used to play with friends on your local network, but we will be exploiting it to enable our cheats ;)

Set the Gamemode to creative if you want, but our main goal is to enable cheats in which we will allow cheats. Then specify a port (Note that you can leave it blank as it will choose a random port between 1024 to 65355).

Now we have cheats enabled, just type on the command line:
/gamemode creative sale7123

I wrote sale7123 since it's the account I used on TLauncher.

And now voila!! We have created mode and we can now escape the prison!

You can fly in creative mode using double jump. (Jump = Press Space)

Then hold space to fly up a bit.
You will see that just outside the bedrock room you will see two signs, head over and read them.

You will see that on one of the signs there is a pastebin link. Go ahead! Write it down and visit the link!
